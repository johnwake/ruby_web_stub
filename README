Welcome, 

I have a simple Hello World example for you to explian how Cucumber works in a BDD way. 

To Get Started you need to install the following Ruby Gems.

$ gem install cucumber
$ gem install rpsec

One this is installed you free to run your this Cucumber test. You can do this my typing $ cucumber features

All Tests should pass and give you a nice green output. 

*(If none of tests have passed make sure that cucumber and rspec are correctly isntalled and try again..)
